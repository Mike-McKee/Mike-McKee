### Welcome to this Data Dork's GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I don't want to bore you right now (especially since I've got some cool code for you to check out), so I'll make this simple...

I'm a bit of a math wiz, graduating with a math degree from Binghamton University. While there, I studied Python a bit but never pursued it seriously.

Now (almost 3 years later), I'm diving back into the language to do some cool coding projects.

**Warning: I only started self-studying Python on June 19th, 2023. So judge my skills based on that.**

Anyway, if you see anything cool here and wanna talk programming, hit me up on my website below:
