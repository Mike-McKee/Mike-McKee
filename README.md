## Hey, I'm Mike. Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a data analyst and I like to write about data/tech [here](https://www.mikemckeewrites.com).

I started learning how to program/code in 2023, around the same time I decided to become a data analyst. But after a few months, I stopped. I'm back now, however, because I want to build things from scratch - like websites, applications, and automation tools.

More to come...
